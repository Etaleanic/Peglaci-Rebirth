    "Dreadwing has been seen in this sector, harassing colonists and generally making a disruptive fool of himself. Be forewarned that other Peacekeepers have attempted to lure him by setting up a distress signal, then take him out. He took the bait... and their lives. Do not attempt this without serious firepower. Alternative methods are encouraged."
